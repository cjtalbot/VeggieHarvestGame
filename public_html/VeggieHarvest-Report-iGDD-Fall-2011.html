		<center><h1>Veggie Harvest Game Final Report</h1></center><br>
		<h3>What are you most proud of about your game?</h3>
		It is a fun game which can be challenging even for an experienced player, but also relaxing enough to be played by a beginner.  It has educational undertones
		where it teaches the player a little about veggie soil preferences.<br>
		<h3>What changes did you make to your original game design for technical reasons?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Gui buttons instead of physical objects</b></p>
				We started out with the plans to utilize physical card objects for the veggie chips.  However, due to the complexity of adding the 3D objects and the requirements
				to maintain 2D functionality only, we swapped it out for GUI.Buttons and GUI.Labels for the same effect.</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Clicking items instead of dragging them so controller can work</b>
				We thought about making the user interaction drag the items around when selected, however due to the requirements to support a
				controller, we had to change it.  We now select an item, then select where to place or play it.  This enables us to use a highlighted
				box around objects when using the controller and select and place them on the board easily.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What changes did you make to your original game design for playability reasons?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Added difficulty level for flow maintenance</b></p>
				We started out with the AI player playing always with a set of strategies that would work to its benefit, albeit at a very slow pace (5 seconds between plays).
				After playtesting, we found that this was not as fair as it could be, but also not as challenging.  Therefore, we incorporated
				a difficulty setting that allowed the player to make it harder &amp; faster to play, based on their preferences.  This also incorporated some
				"dumbed-down" AI player moves, which decreases as the difficulty is increased.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>Realtime playing instead of turn-based</b></p>
				The initial game design called for a turn-based play due to the structure of using a physical board game.  When moving to an electronic medium,
				we found that changing it to a realtime / simultaneous play with the computer would be more interactive and engaging.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What did you learn from your playtesters?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Speed of play slow</b></p>
				Players complained that they had to wait too long to get choices to play.  We took that input and sped up the rate at
				which choices are given to the players, plus ensured that players will always get at least one card for each timeframe.</p>
				</li>
			<li><b>Colors bland</b></p>
				Players complained that the board was a bit bland/boring.  We modified the background images to better represent the 
				soils they represented and made the colors align better with the theme of the game.</p>
				</li>
			<li><b>Feedback missing</b></p>
				Players weren't sure if the game picked up that they were doing something and couldn't tell what they had selected.  We
				added click sounds for proper clicks, and error sounds for wrong clicks.  We also incorporated a blue background for
				selected cards to indicate what is currently selected &amp; ready to be played.</p>
				</li>
			<li><b>Not clear on turnbased vs realtime</b></p>
				Players that had played the game previously weren't sure if it was still turn based or realtime.  We added some information
				in our rules and instructions, as well as added a countdown screen as you enter the game to indicate the player should play quickly.</p>
				</li>
			<li><b>Unable to tell difference of their plants vs others</b></p>
				Players were unable to tell which plants were theirs vs the computers.  We incorporated a yellow background for the veggies planted
				by the AI player, and a light blue background for the veggies planted by the human player.</p>
				</li>
			<li><b>Can't tell how score is being calculated</b></p>
				Players weren't sure how to tell if they were winning or not and why.  We made the scores stand out more, plus added red bars on the
				bottom of the images for items that were planted in the wrong location and were counting against their score.  We also included
				more details on this within the instructions/rules pages.</p>
				</li>
			<li><b>Non-clickable items shouldn't appear as buttons</b></p>
				Players commented that items looked like buttons, but were not clickable / did not do anything.  We changed those items (the score
				areas, message center, etc) and added audio feedback to reinforce that those were not valid clickable items.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What would you do next if you had more time?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Add networking to play person to person OR person to AI</b></p>
				It would be pretty neat to get two human players to play against each other.  In fact, we received a few questions from players during
				the playtesting asking if they were playing against their neighbor.</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Add more animations for destruction and grow wiggling</b></p>
				It would be nice to add more animations for destroying the veggies and a wiggling to indicate they were growing in size on the board.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What would you do differently next time?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Get the core functionality built earlier</b></p>
				We had difficulty in getting the core functionality in.  It took > 3 weeks for that, which caused the rest of the
				project to be a scramble to get any bells or whistles incorporated.</p>
			</li>
			<li><b>Be more prepared for playtesting &amp; have cleaner application at that time</b></p>
				Because of the delays with the core functionality, we were not as prepared with a somewhat polished game for the
				playtesting date.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
