			<li><u>Thursday, September 22, 2011 In-class</u></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Players asked about who gets which chips</li>
					<li>Players asked which card deck was which</li>
					<li>Players didn't know how to plant the plants - kept cards on the squares</li>

					<li>Players forgot to add the chips after each round, but eventually added on their turn (liked that change)</li>
					<li>Players didn't draw the correct number of cards, so didn't destroy plants</li>
					<li>Wasn't clear where to place plants when their soil was full, so didn't plant at all</li>
					<li>Not clear on what can kill with the destroy cards - were destroying entire plant as "1" plant instead of one chip</li>
					<li>Noticed didn't really read/understand rules too well</li>
				</ul>

			<br>
			<li><u>Tuesday, September 27, 2011 Game Night</u></li>

				<ul>
					<li><b>First Session 6:17pm-6:43pm</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Used poker chip toss to determine first player</li>
							<li>Wasn't clear on the difference between the same-soil squares</li>
							<li>Not sure on what to do with the poker chips</li>
							<li>Read rules while they played, not before</li>

							<li>Played plants on same squares</li>
							<li>Thought the destroy cards only destroyed own plants</li>
							<li>When grew new plant for the volcanic soil, they grew another tomato on the volcanic soil</li>
							<li>Thought had to destroy entire number on card</li>
							<li>Not clear on what a "plant" was</li>
							<li>Stopped drawing the destroy cards - saw it as a penalty</li>

							<li>Near end, saw the losing points if on wrong soil</li>
							<li>Unclear on whether need to plant your cards no matter what or discard - they discarded them</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li><b>Second Session 6:52pm-7:15pm</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Both players took about 3 -5 minutes to read the rules but didn't read them in entirety.</li>

	         		        <li>The players didn't understand how to start the game (who goes 1st).</li>
					        <li>The players had to reread the rules several times during the game to understand the basic game mechanics and gameplay.</li>
					        <li>The players didn't place the cards in the discard pile and copied one another instead of reading the rules.</li>
					        <li>Players didn't grow plants before continuing with their turn.</li>
							<li>Players finally figured out the the usage of the white plant chips and where to discard the cards (face-up).</li>
							<li>Players didn't place the white plant chips on the top of the stack of red/blue chips.</li>

							<li>One player thought that the size of the game board squares was for the placement of the growth cards.</li>
							<li>Even with the clarity of the rules of the die (0,1,2), both players still used and interpreted "1" incorrectly.</li>
							<li>Players had to keep referring to the rules and didn't understand the concept of stacking = growing of plants.</li>
							<li>At this point, players figured out how to add one chip to their stack at the beginning of each turn.</li>
							<li>Players finally found out how to use white plant chips correctly.</li>
							<li>Both players only plucked cards from the growth deck instead of incorporating strategy with destruction cards.</li>

							<li>One player said the rules are a little vague and complex. </li>
						</ul>
